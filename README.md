# Infinities:

- removes the need to have arrows in your inventory when using Infinity enchanted items.
- allows you to combine Infinity + Mending (configurable).
- allows you to enchant crossbows with Infinity (configurable).
- is optional on clients if installed on a server.

It's basically an updated and fixed clone of [Infinity Fix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infinity-fix).
